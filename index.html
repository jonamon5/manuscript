                <span class="r-letter">R</span>AYMOND WILLIAMS’S ESSAY
              </span>
              was originally written as a chapter in his 1961 book The Long
              Revolution, but was published only later and as an essay. It
              belongs to an older form of British-orientated cultural studies
              than the other essays collected here, but one that it is important
              not to forget. It stands apart in two main ways: first, for
              Williams, cultural studies moves unproblematically back into
              cultural history. For him, telling the story of advertising’s
              development allows one to grasp the forces which condition it now,
              and also, thus, to begin to be able to conceive of a different
              contemporary function for advertising. Second, Williams writes as
              a committed socialist; for him private sector capitalism cannot
              fulfill the needs of society as a whole. Today it is, perhaps,
              harder to promote state socialism than to insist that cultural
              studies requires historical narratives. But it is not as though
              these two strands of Williams’s essay are quite separate. For him,
              the history of advertising shows a minor mode of communication
              becoming a major one – a vital component in the organization and
              reproduction of capital. In a metaphor which goes back to Marx’s
              belief that capitalism makes commodities <q>fetishes</q>, for
              Williams advertising is <q>magic</q> because it transforms
              commodities into glamorous signifiers (turning a car into a sign
              of masculinity, for instance) and these signifiers present an
              imaginary, in the sense of unreal, world. Most of all, capitalism
              makes us forget how much work and suffering went into the
              production of commodities. Williams’s history aims to dis-enchant
              capitalism: to show us what it really is. It might be objected, of
              course, that advertising’s magic (like many magics) actually
              works: that, today, the use-value of many commodities is their
              signifying-function. But that objection (and others) which may
              occur to readers does not spoil the essay’s power to defamiliarize
              the current advertising industry through erudite narrative
              history.

            Mention of the physicians begins that process of extension from the
            conventional recommendations of books as ‘excellent’ or ‘admirable’
            and the conventional branding, packaging and a good ‘selling line’.
            I remember being told by a man I knew at university (he had
            previously explained how useful, to his profession as an advertiser,
            had been his training in the practical criticism of advertisements)
            that advertisements you booked and paid for were really old stuff;
            the real thing was what got through as ordinary news. This seems to
            happen now with goods: ‘product centenaries’, for example. But with
            persons it is even more extensive. It began in entertainment,
            particularly with film actors, and it is still in this field that it
            does most of its work. It is very difficult to pin down, because the
            borderline between the item or photograph picked up in the ordinary
            course of journalism and broadcasting, and the similar item or
            photograph that has been arranged and paid for, either directly or
            through special hospitality by a publicity agent, is obviously
            difficult to draw. Enough stories get through, and are even boasted
            about, to indicate that the paid practice is extensive, though
            payment, except to the agent, is usually in hospitality (if that
            word can be used) or in kind. Certainly, readers of newspapers
            should be aware that the ‘personality’ items, presented as ordinary
            news stories or gossip, will often have been paid for, in one way or
            another, in a system that makes straightforward advertising, by
            comparison, look respectable. Nor is this confined to what is called
            ‘show business’; it has certainly entered literature, and it has
            probably entered politics. The extension is natural, in a society
            where selling, by any effective means, has become a primary ethic.
            The spectacular growth of advertising, and then its extension to
            apparently independent reporting, has behind it not a mere pressure
            group, as in the days of the quacks, but the whole impetus of a
            society. It can then be agreed that we have come a long way from the
            papyrus of the runaway slave and the shouts of the town-crier: that
            what we have to look at is an organized and extending system, at the
            centre of our national life.

              <span>IN THIS ESSAY</span>, Raymond William explores the history
              of advertising, and how it evolved from a simple means of
              spreading information into the major cornerstone of capitalism
              today; shaping consumer behaviors, perceptions about each other,
              and prioritizing profit over the collective and social
              responsibility. William’s use of the word <q>magic</q> to describe
              modern advertising can be closely associated with user experience
              and interaction design. Both having the end goal of designing an
              engaging user experience for the customer, often building a
              unified narrative around the product. An example would be how
              Mercedes Benz commercials and their digital presence create a
              feeling of luxury, sophistication, and class to their products.
              The function of the car comes second to the way it’s supposed to
              make you feel.

          Even though this essay was written in 1961, many of his ideas hold
          true today. His belief that modern advertising practices focus on
          profit over social responsibility and even the end customer are true
          today more than ever. Multinational companies that engage in ethically
          questionable business practices often purposefully hide those facts in
          their advertisements or simply ignore them all together. They only
          highlight the product themselves, and the status you will have when
          you own that item.

            effects on the end consumer.

        <p>
          Companies today are paying exorbitant fees to netizens with large
          followings (within the companies target audience) to promote their
          products. These influencers are given the products for free and
          usually have to hit certain key talking points to satisfy their
          contract requirements. These are essentially paid advertisements,
          disguised as organic reviews from a neutral third party. Consumers are
          easily tricked into buying these products (many of which they don’t
          need) simply because someone they trust has promoted them. If you
          scroll through any social media app, you will see paid, organic, and
          sponsored advertisements flooding your feed. I understand that
          companies and people need to make money, but there has to be a more
          ethical way of spreading your brand/product to the consumer.

        <p>
          Having read this essay and reflected on the current stage of
          advertising in my own professional career and personal life, I agree
          with Raymond Williams on many points. Advertising’s only goal today is
          to grab as many eyeballs as possible. This is why we see them on every
          site imaginable, including social media apps (Facebook, Instagram,
          TikTok), video sharing platforms (YouTube, Twitch), mobile games, and
          even news sites. The saturation of advertisements in the digital space
          has undoubtedly changed the way consumers buy products, connect with
          products, and view themselves. Having said all that, I do disagree
          with William’s claim that capitalism is unable to fill the needs of
          the society. Advertisements and user experience designs can/have
          informed and empowered consumers about products in their lives. Modern
          user experience design especially, has progressed to include ethical
          considerations such as accessibility, inclusive design and user
          empowerment, remedying some of the capitalist beliefs that Williams
          mentioned. As a marketer and designer, I aim to balance the need for
          advertisements in today’s society with the ethical considerations that
          go along with it, ensuring the end user’s needs are met without
          creating superficial consumerist desires.
